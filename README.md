# 7-Tap-Hanning-Rectangular-Filters
This work space allows the user to filter .wav files using  7-Tap Rectangular and Hanning Filters and graphs their frequency responses. 
To change which .wav function you'd like to filter, simply change the 'tea.wav' file to 'desired_file.wav.' This workspace calls two different functions:
digital_filter_rect and digital_filter_hann. The skeleton of these functions was written by Dr. Wayne Pilkington at Cal Poly, but it did not include
the filter coefficient arrays or the difference equation that is written to the Write_DAC function. For _7_Tap_Rect_and_Hann_Filters.m to run, you must also download
the two filter files.
